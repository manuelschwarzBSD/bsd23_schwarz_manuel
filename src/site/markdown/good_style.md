# Writing Good Source Code Comments
## Best Practices

#### Be Clear and Concise:

Use simple language and keep comments brief.

#### Explain the Why, Not the What:

Focus on why a solution was chosen, not what the code does.
Example: // Using loop to avoid recursion overflow.

#### Keep Comments Up-to-Date:

Update comments when code changes to avoid misinformation.

#### Avoid Obvious Comments:

Skip comments that state the obvious.
Example: // Initialize i is unnecessary for int i = 0;.

#### Explain Complex Logic:

Provide high-level overviews for complex code.
Example: // This algorithm uses dynamic programming to....

#### Use Documentation Comments for Public APIs:

# Writing Good Git Commit Messages

## Best Practices

#### Write Clear, Descriptive Messages:

Summarize changes in a concise way.
Example: Fix bug in user authentication.

#### Use the Imperative Mood:

Write as if giving commands.
Example: Add new validation for input fields.

#### Keep the First Line Short:

Limit to 50 characters, followed by a blank line and a detailed description if needed.

#### Explain the Why:

Describe why the change was made, not just what was changed.
Example: Refactor code to improve readability.

#### Group Related Changes:

Commit related changes together, avoid bundling unrelated changes in one commit.

#### Review Before Committing:

Proofread commit messages for clarity and correctness.
