# Encryption
***
##### Description:
Encryption is a Java based program using the ceasars cypher and user input. The input asked from the user is a string (= the word which will be encrypted) and a integer (= the offset/rotation  by which each character of the string is gonna be shifted)
##### How to start Encryption:
Encryption is not a executable programm at the moment:
1. though you can download the Encryption.java, Menu.java & TextEncrypt.java off my [**github repository.**](https://github.com/dermanuelschwarz/dermanuelschwarz)
2. To **execute** said .java files you will have to **open & compile** the files in an IDE (integreated developement environment) of your choice .
3. **Compile** the files to get a .class file. 
4. Now you can **run the Programm** by clicking the dedicated button or pressing the according shortcut. (Generally a combination of __ctrl + any f key__ )
##### How to use Encryption:
The programm will ask you for the input of a word and a number. Then you will recieve your encrypted word. Pretty neat right?
